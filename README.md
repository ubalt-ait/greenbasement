# Green Basement

This project creates an automated controllable indoor growth system using Arduinos and Raspberry Pis. The goals of the project are the following:

- Short-term
  - Let computer programming students gain hands-on exprience in a technology that is applied to a different field
  - Create a system that can be used by Environmental Sustainability students to design and run experiments
- Medium-term
  - Build a system that grows enough produce to help the on-campus pantry, which supprts students in need of food
- Long-term
  - Create a modular system that can be housed into vacant homes in food deserts, to help the community access fresh produce
